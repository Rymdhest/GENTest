Description:
Program to calculate the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) of a model.
The program contains the pre trained InceptionV3 model for evaluation.
The application also plots both the real images and generated images on the webpage.

How to run:
1. run "pip install Flask Flask-CORS numpy scipy" to get the required python packages
2. in this folder run "python pyHelper.py" to start the flask server
3. Open the 'index.html' file in your web browser.
4. Wait for the result to load.

Files:
- index.html: The main HTML file to run the application. 
- tensorflow.js: The JavaScript file containing the FID and IS implementations.
- PyHelper.py: Flask server to provide sqrtm() from scipy and covariance() from numpy.

Parameters to change in the javascript file:
- IMAGE_H: the width of the source images (default: 28)
- IMAGE_W: the height of the source images (default: 28)
- MODEL_INPUT_SIZE: the image size required for the model input (default: 299)
- GENERATOR_INPUT_SIZE: the input size of the generator to generate images from (default: 100)
- SAMPLE_SIZE: how many images to use in score calculations (default: 1000)
